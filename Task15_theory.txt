Difference between map and flatMap
-- Map only returns one elements while flatmap return a list of element as an iterator

Creating RDD's
--Two ways are 
1. Parallelizing an existing collection in your driver program
2. Referencing a dataset in an external storage system such as shared filesystem, HDFS, HBase, or any data source offering a Hadoop InputFormat

Map and mapValues

map is a transformation operation and is narrow in nature
mapvalue is only for PairRDD's 
mapvalues operate on the value only, while map operated on entire record which can be tuple of key and value.
